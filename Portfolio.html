    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As a dedicated Python developer, I have expanded my expertise by mastering <span class="highlight">HTML</span>, <span class="highlight">CSS</span>, and <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span>, enabling me to craft dynamic and responsive web applications. <br><br>
        I have solved over <span class="highlight">200 problems on LeetCode</span>, demonstrating my strong problem-solving skills and commitment to continuous learning. <br><br>
        My open-source contributions include active participation in <span class="highlight-background">Hacktoberfest</span> and numerous projects on <span class="highlight-background">GitHub</span>, reflecting my dedication to community-driven development. <br><br>
        I have developed several projects, including: <br>
        - <span class="highlight-background">"TASK ODYSSEY APP"</span>: A task management application designed to help users efficiently organize and track their daily activities. <br>
        - <span class="highlight-background">Book Management System</span>: A library management system developed as a team project to streamline book tracking and management. <br>
        - <span class="highlight-background">Hope</span>: A health-related project aimed at promoting well-being, also developed as a team initiative. <br>
        - <span class="highlight-background">Farmer Friend</span>: My most significant project, developed for my startup, focusing on providing advanced solutions for farmers. This project involved extensive research and development to meet the specific needs of the agricultural community. <br><br>
        Currently, I am enhancing my skills by studying <span class="highlight">React.js</span> and <span class="highlight">Node.js</span>, and I have completed <span class="highlight">Java</span> and <span class="highlight">Python</span> courses, solving over <span class="highlight">150 LeetCode problems using Java</span> and numerous <span class="highlight">Codewars challenges</span>. <br><br>
        Additionally, I have ventured into <span class="highlight">mobile web development</span>, creating various mobile applications to broaden my development capabilities. <br><br>
        I am committed to continuous learning and actively seek opportunities to apply my skills in innovative projects.</p>
